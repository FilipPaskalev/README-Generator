## Dependencies

### Chalk 4.0.0

[NPM chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk/v/5.3.0) is a third-party Node.js module that is used to add colour and styling to text on the command-line output. It also allows creating your own themes for your Node.js project. As per the Chalk GitHub page, it is: 

>Terminal string styling done right

Chalk supports multiple text styles with backgrounds supporting different colours and formatting. For instance, you can show text in red colour with a grey background that is bold and underlined. The chalk module is easy to install and use, depending on your terminal colours it can support a lot of colours.

It is an actively maintained project without any dependencies. Chalk also has an expressive API and it is a performant library. In the next part, you will know about the popularity of the NPM chalk module.
  - Chalk is a library for styling command-line output. It provides a cleaner way to add color and styling to your console.log messages.

### inquirer 8.0.0

Inquirer is an [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/9.2.15?activeTab=readme#documentation) package that provides an easy way to capture user input in your Node.js command line interface applications. It provides several methods for asking questions and returning answers from the user that can be accessed by a .then promise function.

## Development Dependencies

### JSDoc 4.0.2

[JSDoc 3](https://jsdoc.app/about-getting-started) is an API documentation generator for JavaScript, similar to Javadoc. You add documentation comments directly to your source code, right alongside the code itself. The JSDoc tool will scan your source code and generate an HTML documentation website for you.

JSDoc's purpose is to document the API of your JavaScript application or library. It is assumed that you will want to document things like modules, namespaces, classes, methods, method parameters, and so on.

### Prettier 3.2.5

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter with support for:

- JavaScript (including experimental features)
- JSX
- Angular
- Vue
- Flow
- TypeScript
- CSS, Less, and SCSS
- HTML
- Ember/Handlebars
- JSON
- GraphQL
- Markdown, including GFM and MDX v1
- YAML

It removes all original styling* and ensures that all outputted code conforms to a consistent style. (See this [blog post](https://archive.jlongster.com/A-Prettier-Formatter))

Prettier takes your code and reprints it from scratch by taking the line length into account.


## Tests
Automated tests can be added in the future to ensure the stability and functionality of the application. At version 1.0.0 are no tests.
